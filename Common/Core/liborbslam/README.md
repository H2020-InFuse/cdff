# Liborbslam
This library is a slightly customized fork of the open-source ORB-SLAM2 implementation. It provides a complete SLAM system, able to perform a robust tracking in Mono, Stereo and RGBD images. 

 For the full details on the SLAM implementation, please see:  Raúl Mur-Artal and Juan D. Tardós. ORB-SLAM2: an Open-Source SLAM System for Monocular, Stereo and RGB-D Cameras. IEEE Transactions on Robotics, vol. 33, no. 5, pp. 1255-1262, 2017. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.06475.pdf

## Dependencies
See Dependencies.md for a complete list of Orb-Slam dependencies.

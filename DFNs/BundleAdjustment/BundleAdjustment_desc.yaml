      doc: sequence of correspondence maps between pairs of features sets.
           the correspondence maps sequence is obtained from n features sets
           extracted from n images taken by a stereo camera pair.
           The sequence contains n*(n-1) correspondence maps between all the 
           possible pairs of feature sets.
           If we order the features set as L1, R1, L2, R2, ..., Lm, Rm, with m = n/2 then
           the correspondence maps are ordered as (L1-R1), (L1-L2), (L1-R2), ..., 
           (L1-Lm), (L1-Rm), (R1,L2), (R1,R2), ..., (R1, Lm), (R1,Rm), ..., (Lm, Rm).
           the maximum number of features set is n = 8, for a maximum number of 56 maps.

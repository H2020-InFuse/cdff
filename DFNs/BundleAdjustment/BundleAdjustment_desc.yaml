      doc: sequence of correspondence maps between pairs of features sets.
           the correspondence maps sequence is obtained from n features sets
           extracted from n images taken by a stereo camera pair.
           The sequence contains n*(n-1) correspondence maps between all the 
           possible pairs of feature sets.
           If we order the features set as L1, R1, L2, R2, ..., Lm, Rm, with m = n/2 then
           the correspondence maps are ordered as (L1-R1), (L1-L2), (L1-R2), ..., 
           (L1-Lm), (L1-Rm), (R1,L2), (R1,R2), ..., (R1, Lm), (R1,Rm), ..., (Lm, Rm).
           the maximum number of features set is n = 8, for a maximum number of 28 maps.

      doc: This is an initial estimation of the camera poses, except the first camera. This input is optional,
           as some algorithm may not need it. Set to an empty sequence if the input is
           not provided.

      type: asn1SccPointcloud
      doc: This is an initial estimation of the 3d position of the features detected by the
           first camera in the reference frame of the first camera. 3d points are listed in
           the order in which the features appear in the first correspondence map (L1-R1).
           This input is optional, as some algorirthms may not need it. Set to empty cloud
           if the input is not provided.

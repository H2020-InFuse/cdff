            as a pointcloud of the same size.
            This input is unnecessary for implementations of this DFN that
            compute surface normals, and necessary for implementations that
            expect surface normals to be provided. Other implementations may be
            able to accommodate both cases: for instance, the ShotDescriptor3D
            implementation of this DFN exposes the following parameters to let
            its user control the estimation of normals:
            * if ForceNormalEstimation is true:
              surface normal estimates are computed regardless of the provided
              normals
            * otherwise:
              * if EnableNormalEstimation is false:
                the provided normals are used, unless they're grossly wrong
                (e.g. less normals than points), in which case an exception is
                thrown
              * if EnableNormalEstimation is true:
                the provided normals are used, unless they're grossly wrong
                (e.g. less normals than points), in which case better estimates
                are computed"

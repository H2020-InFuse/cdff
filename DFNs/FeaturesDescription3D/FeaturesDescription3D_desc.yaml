      type: PointCloud
      doc: a 3D point cloud taken from a 3D sensor or assembled by 3D reconstruction
    - name: featuresSet
      type: VisualPointFeatureVector3D
      doc: this is the list of Visual Point detected by a previous processing step. Their descriptors are empty. The points are defined by a reference to the input point cloud.
    - name: normalsCloud
      type: PointCloud
      doc: This is the optional cloud of estimated normals to the surface represented by the first point cloud. This input may be optional depending on DFNs, as normals may be estimated in this DFN.
	   As a suggestion for the implementation of different DFNs, one may use two parameters ForceNormalEstimation and EnableNormalEstimation:
           If parameter ForceNormalEstimation is set to true, this input will be ignored; otherwise:
	   If parameter EnableNormalEstimation is set to false, an empty input or invalid input will cause an exception,
	   If parameter EnableNormalEstimation is set to true, normals will be estimated when this input is empty or not valid.
output_ports:
    - name: featuresSetWithDescriptors
      type: VisualPointFeatureVector3D
      doc: This is the same list of visual point defined above. A descriptor is associated to each point. The points may be defined by position or references according to a configuration parameter.

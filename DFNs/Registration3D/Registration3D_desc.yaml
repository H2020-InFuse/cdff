    - name: sourceCloud
      type: asn1SccPointcloud
      doc: 3D pointcloud captured by a 3D sensor
           or reconstructed from other perceptions
    - name: sinkCloud

      doc: 3D pointcloud captured by a 3D sensor

    - name: transformGuess
      type: asn1SccPose
      doc: this is the initial transform estimation of the source point
           cloud relatively to the coordinate frame of the sink point cloud.
    - name: useGuess
      type: bool
      doc: this determines whether the transform guess should be used or not.
           If it is not used and the implementation requires an estimation,
           the identity transform will be used as an initial guess. If the guess
           is used and the implementation does not require an estimation,
           an error is thrown.
output_ports:
    - name: transform
      type: asn1SccPose
      doc: pose of the source point cloud relatively to the coordinate 
           frame of the sink point cloud
    - name: success
      type: bool
      doc: boolean flag indicating successful computation of the geometric
           transformation between the point clouds. Computation may fail if
           the point clouds are not similar enough; in this case the
           transform is meaningless.

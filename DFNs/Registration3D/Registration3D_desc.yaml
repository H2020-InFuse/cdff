      doc: initial pose estimate of the coordinate frame of the source
           pointcloud relative to the coordinate frame of the sink pointcloud
    - name: useGuess
      type: bool
      doc: boolean flag indicating whether the initial estimate of the
           geometric transformation between the pointclouds should be used.
           If it is set to not be used, and a particular implementation of this
           DFN requires an initial estimate, that implementation shall use the
           identity transformation as the estimate. If it is set to be used,
           and a particular implementation of this DFN does not require an
           initial estimate, that implementation must throw an error.

           the coordinate frame of the sink pointcloud
    - name: success
      type: bool
      doc: boolean flag indicating successful computation of the geometric
           transformation between the pointcloud frames. Computation may fail
           if the pointclouds are not similar enough; in that case, the
           returned geometric transformation is meaningless.

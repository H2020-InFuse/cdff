      doc: 	This is a list coordinates of physical points in two distinct images taken from a camera. The set contains pairs of 2d coordinates ( (x1, y1), (x2, y2)), each pair represents the same 
		physical point. (x1, y1) is its position in the first camera image and (x2, y2) is its position in the second camera image.
output_ports:
    - name: fundamentalMatrix
      type: Matrix3d
      doc: This is the fundamental matrix of the camera pair that took the two images.
    - name: success
      type: boolean
      doc: This outputs tells whether the matrix computation was succesfull. The computation may fail if the inputs are not good. If the computation fails the first output is meaningless.

doc: DFN that estimates the fundamental matrix of a camera pair based on pairs
     of 2D matching keypoints found in two images that the cameras captured

      doc: "keypoint matches between two images A and B. This is a list of
            pairs of 2D coordinates: ((x^A_1, y^A_1), (x^B_1, y^B_1)), ...,
            ((x^A_n, y^A_n), (x^B_n, y^B_n)). Each pair contains the
            coordinates of the same keypoint (hopefully, the same physical
            point) in each image."

      doc: boolean flag indicating successful matrix computation. Fundamental
           matrix computation may fail if the matches are not good enough; in
           that case, the returned matrix is meaningless.

    - name: pointCloud
      type: PointCloud
      doc: this is the set of 3d points representing the scene in some reference coordinate system.
    - name: cameraFeaturesVector
      type: VisualPointFeatureVector2D
      doc: these are the 2d image coordinates of the 3d points as they are observed by the camera.
output_ports:
    - name: pose
      type: Pose3D
      doc: This is the pose of the camera in the reference coordinate system of the point cloud.
    - name: success
      type: bool
      doc: This boolean value determines whether a valid pose could be found. If this value is false, pose is meaningless.

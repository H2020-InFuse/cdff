name: ModelBasedDetection
doc: DFN that performs model-based detection and pose detection. A training stage is required to learn some object characteristics, using the CAD model of the object. During the detection, the current object is matched to the training set, allowing to detect the object and to retrieve the corresponding trained pose.

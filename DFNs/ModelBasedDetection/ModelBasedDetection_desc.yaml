name: ModelBasedDetection
doc: DFN that performs model-based detection and pose detection. The DFN uses cameras to detect an object of interest and computes the homogeneous transformation that maps a 3D point expressed in the object frame into the camera frame.
input_ports:
    - name: image
      type: asn1SccFrame
      doc: This is a colored image
    - name: depth
      type: asn1SccFrame
      doc: This is a depth image
output_ports:
    - name: pose
      type: asn1SccPose
      doc: the homogeneous transformation that maps a 3D point expressed in the object frame into the camera frame
    - name: detectionBoundingBox
      type: asn1SccMatrix2d
      doc: the detection bounding box, indexes (row,col) to access the info are x=(0,0), y=(0,1), width=(1,0), height(1,1)
    - name: success
      type: bool
      doc: boolean flag indicating successful Linemod detection. If false, the returned pose is meaningless.
implementations:

      doc: 	This is a list coordinates of physical points in two distinct images taken from a camera (or cameras). The set contains pairs of 2d coordinates ( (x1, y1), (x2, y2)), each pair 
		represents the same physical point. (x1, y1) is its position in the first camera image and (x2, y2) is its position in the second camera image.

      type: Matrix3d
      doc: This is the fundamental matrix of the camera that took the two images.
    - name: secondEpipole
      type: Point2D
      doc: This is the epipole of the second camera view.
output_ports:
    - name: pointCloud
      type: PointCloud
      doc: This is the 3d point cloud representing the matching point in a 3D space. The system is aligned with the pose of the camera when the first image was taken.

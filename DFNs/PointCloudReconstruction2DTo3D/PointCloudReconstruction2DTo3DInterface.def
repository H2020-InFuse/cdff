      doc: 	This is a list coordinates of physical points in two distinct images taken from a camera (or cameras). The set contains pairs of 2d coordinates ( (x1, y1), (x2, y2)), each pair 
		represents the same physical point. (x1, y1) is its position in the first camera image and (x2, y2) is its position in the second camera image.

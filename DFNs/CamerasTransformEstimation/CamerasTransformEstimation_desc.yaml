      doc: "keypoint matches between images A and B. This is a list of pairs of
            2D coordinates: ((x_A1, y_A1), (x_B1, y_B1)),
            ((x_A2, y_A2), (x_B2, y_B2)), ... The geometric transformation
            between the two camera frames is deduced from these points, so the
            matches should be as reliable as possible."

      doc: boolean flag indicating successful computation of the geometric
           transformation between the camera frames. Computation may fail if
           the matches are not good enough; in that case, the returned
           geometric transformation is meaningless.

    - name: matches
      type: asn1SccCorrespondenceMap2D
      doc: "keypoint matches between the images A and B. This is a list of
            pairs of 2D coordinates: ((x^A_1, y^A_1), (x^B_1, y^B_1)), ...,
            ((x^A_n, y^A_n), (x^B_n, y^B_n)). Each pair contains the
            coordinates of the same keypoint (hopefully, the same physical
            point) in each image.
            The geometric transformation between the two camera frames is
            deduced from these points, so the matches should be as reliable
            as possible."

    - name: success
      type: bool
      doc: boolean flag indicating successful computation of the geometric
           transformation between the camera frames. Computation may fail if
           the matches are not good enough; in that case, the returned
           geometric transformation is meaningless.

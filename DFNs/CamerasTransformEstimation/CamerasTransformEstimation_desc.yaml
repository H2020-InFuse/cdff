input_ports:
    - name: fundamentalMatrix
      type: Matrix3d
      doc: This is the fundamental matrix of the camera pair that took the two images
    - name: correspondenceMap
      type: CorrespondenceMap2D
      doc: This is a set of correspondence between points (x, y) in one image to point (x', y') in the other image. These are test points for the final transform, they should be as reliable as possible.
output_ports:
    - name: transform
      type: Transform3D
      doc: This is the relative pose of the camera that took the second image into the system of the camera that took the first image.
    - name: success
      type: boolean
      doc: This outputs tells whether the computation was succesfull. The computation may fail if the inputs are not good. If the computation fails the first output is meaningless.

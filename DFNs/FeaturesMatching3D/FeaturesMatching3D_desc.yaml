      doc: these are the extracted features of the 3D point cloud model we would like to discover in the other point cloud.
    - name: sinkFeaturesVector
      type: VisualPointFeatureVector3D
      doc: these are the extracted features of the 3D point cloud into which we are looking for the model.
output_ports:
    - name: transform
      type: Transform3D
      doc: This is the best 3D trasform correspondence that matches source features to sink features.
    - name: success
      type: bool
      doc: This is a boolean value representing whether it was really possible to compute a valid transform. If this value is false the transform is meaningless.
